# YakBak

A project to test out as many different front end techniques and new frameworks as possible. When Yik Yak was closed down early in 2017, I remembered how enjoyable it was to use at Uni.

It couldn't be too hard to make an API and backend that doesn't need any users or logins, and then I can deploy that to Heroku so I can use it with as many different front ends as I can.

## API

This is the backend of the project.
